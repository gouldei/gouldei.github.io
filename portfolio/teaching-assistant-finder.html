                                    <p>Objective: We interviewed 4 graduate students about their experiences with finding graduate assistantships. We interviewed 1 math student and 3 CGT students.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Lead: Nick</p>
                                    <p>Objective: We also created a survey to collect information from graduate students about how they find graduate assistantships. This survey collected responses from 10 students and 8 professors.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Objective: 3 of the students who were interviewed also participated in contextual inquiries. 2 of these students could not find any assistantships, the third could only find a print application he could submit. All subjects agreed it was easier to talk to professors personally and ask about assistantships than searching online.</p>

                                    <p>Objective: Using affinity diagramming to analyze the data we collected from the interviews, surveys, and contextual inquiries, we discovered some trends among the subjects.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Most students would like a website to find assistantships, but some still would prefer to use direct contact with professors.</li>
                                        <li>Most professors and students in CGT currently use direct contact to find an assistantship.</li>
                                        <li>Both professors and students who do not have large networks of contacts have a much more difficult time than those who do.</li>
                                        <li>Finding an assistantship is a slow process.</li>

                                    <p>Each team member developed sketches of their ideas for the site. After everyone had developed some idea of the looks and functionality of the site, we came together and compared ideas, then chose the best features of each sketch and refined them.</p>

                                    <p>Having an idea of how the website would look like and work, we developed a storyboard illustrating the process the user would go through to find an assistantship. This further solidified our concepts of the functionality of the new site.</p>

                                    <p>Taking our refined ideas, we used Google Drawings to design more high-fidelity versions.</p>

                                    <p>We had the participants complete a series of tasks. We timed each task and recorded their feedback about their experience. We had the participants use the think-out-loud process. We informed them that it was ok if they could not complete a task. Also, we had them inform us when they believed each task was complete, that way we could assess if the site was giving them proper feedback. We recorded the computer screen and used a webcam to record each user.</p>

                                        <li>Users had a hard time posting an assistantship opening. Users would visit the account page first, rather than the "Job Openings" page where the button was located.</li>

                                        <li>Once learned, the site was easy to navigate. However, there was a slight learning curve.</li>
                                        <li>The profiles had more detail and were more useful than Purdue's own faculty profiles</li>
                                        <li>Users liked how they could input skills</li>
                                        <li>Users liked how professors could add portfolios. That way, grad students can see what professors' research are, which is normally hard to find.</li>

                                        <li>The account menu gives the impression it contains more than just profile information. Either rename it to "Profile" or add more content to the account menu. Possibly add "Create a Posting" to the account menu.</li>
                                        <li>Change the skill search hint text. "Add skills" gives the impression you're adding skills to your profile, not searching for them. The subheading is also unnecessary.</li>

                            <h3>Professors and graduate students have a problem: they have a hard time connecting with each other to fill assistantship positions.</h3>
                            <p>We set out to solve that problem through research and testing of our user group.<br/><br/>We went through several sketches and iterations of our design to come up with an interactive prototype for our target audience to test, and collected data of them using the site through formal usability testing methods including screen capturing, video recording, and timing.<br/><br/>We created a product which professors and graduate students were able to use to fill and find assistantship openings and connect with each other. More design and usability research needs done to make the product pleasant to use.</p><br/>

                                <li>During our user research, doing interviews and talking to graduate students and professors provided significantly more helpful feedback than we got with regular students</li>
                                <li>Listening to our users gave us a lot of insight into problems and possible issues that we didn‚Äôt even consider</li>
                                <li>The feedback we got from our target audience was never the same; everyone always mentioned something to change that the others didn‚Äôt.  This allowed us to get a very good idea of what kind of things each kind of demographic wanted to see</li>
