                                    <p>Objective: Analyze not only theScore's app, but also their competitors. This gave us insight into industry standards and existing solutions to the problem.</p>
                                    <p>Analysis: We discovered four major focus areas to research more:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The Feed: the way in which articles are first presented to the user</li>
                                        <li>Sharing icons: the icons that represent sharing to the user</li>
                                        <li>Auto-generated messages: messages that are automatically typed out for the user when sharing</li>
                                        <li>Messaging: the way in which articles are shared when using a messaging application such as iMessage</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Lead: Nick</p>
                                    <p>During the competitive analysis, the team noticed a lack of link previews within iMessage for only theScore app. Looking at the source code of theScore.com, we realized that theScore was using the Open Graph Protocol to create these previews, of which was coded correctly.<br/><br/>On further research, we learned that iMessage is unique in the fact that if more than one link is in the message, iMessage will not show a link preview because it does not know what link to show the preview for. Other messaging applications such as Facebook Messenger will choose the first link in the message to show a preview for.<br/><br/>We decided to test this by sending a message with one only one link. In this case, iMessage showed a link preview. However, when we sent the same message with two links, it did not show a preview.<br/><br/>When relaying this to our sponsor at theScore, we learned that this was an issue they had noticed, but had never found out the reason why.</p>

                                    <p>We conducted a literature review to try to understand the psychology of sharing more. We wanted to learn why users want to share and to whom they want to share to. By better understanding their intent, we could work to design an interface that accommodated their wants and needs.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>For millennials, which covers most of the target audience, there is no significant difference in social media usage across genders</li>
                                        <li>Men censor their content they share online more than women</li>
                                        <li>Users with more diverse friends censor less</li>
                                        <li>People censor when their audience is harder to define, and people censor more when the relevance of the communication "space" is narrower</li>
                                        <li>People generally post to strengthen relationships, not cause arguments</li>
                                        <li>women have higher loyalty to sports brands and sports apps</li>
                                        <li>Mobile users are more likely to post to Facebook & Twitter than any other social network</li>
                                        <li>There are 5 major factors for contribution online: purposive value, self-discovery, entertainment, enhancing social status, and maintaining relationships</li>
                                        <li>Receiving feedback from friends on a post, perhaps similar to receiving a gift, creates indebtedness and calls for reciprocation</li>

                                    <p>theScore's action buttons within the feed were all white icons for messaging, facebook, twitter, and the iOS share sheet. We tested the shapes of these icons to determine if changing the shape of the icon would influence users' behavior.</p>

We tested the colors of these icons to determine if changing the color of the icon would influence users' behavior.<br/><br/>One major influence on this testing was accessibility. During our research, we found 1/12 men are colorblind. Men being the target audience of theScore, we kept this in mind when making color choices.<br/><br/>We found that the users preferred filled in buttons with rounded corners. The described these buttons as welcoming, smooth, and comfortable.</p>

                                    <p>theScore uses the iOS share sheet icon for external sharing, however our research showed that the share sheet confusing to many, and users don't understand what the icon stands for. We decided to test what icon would be best by conducting preference testing with multiple share icons; some made by us, others, icons that are already used in other apps.<br/><br/>We found that 63% of users ranked the word "Share" as the most understandable icons for sharing, and only 43% of users ranked the iOS share sheet icon as the second most understandable icon.</p>

                                        <p>We randomized the order of the tasks from each user and recorded time-on-task, audio recorded their sessions, and had an exit interview with each participant in which we asked about their likes/dislikes of each prototype/app.</p>

                                        <p>Our findings led us to a list of design recommendations for theScore to increase the sharing of their articles inside their application:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Call-to-action: action buttons should be filled in rounded rectangles using the brand colors of each social network</li>
                                            <li>Color: theScore's brand colors are sufficient for the color-blind population, and theScore should avoid changing them</li>
                                            <li>Icon choice: the share button should be the word "Share" with the iOS share sheet icon to the left of it</li>
                                            <li>Guided process: the sharing process should be a guided process, similar to the "guided process" prototype we developed. This process was the least confusing to users and they reported the highest levels of satisfaction with it</li>
                                            <li>Share wheel: we recommend using a share wheel for sharing in-article, similar to our "Wheel Sharing" prototype</li>
                                            <li>We recommend further testing comparing the "Guided Process" and "Wheel Sharing" prototypes. Due to the contrasting style of the two and where they are designed to share from, we recommend using a Likert system to assess how hard the users believe and find sharing to be. We developed a more detailed protocol for theScore to use to do this.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
