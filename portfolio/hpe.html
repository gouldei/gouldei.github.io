                                    <p>We looked at a variety of articles about updates and notifying users of updates. The main points we found about update notifications were the topics of Habituation, users don't understand why updates are important, and that updates are seen as an inconvenience. We also learned from a paper published in the proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Huan Factors in Computing Systems that updating can be segmented into 6 distinct stages. We used these stages throughout the rest of the project to organize our data and findings.</p>

She was able to give us valuable insight into how she is notified about updates and the process she goes through each time she receives a notification of an update. We were able to discuss her pain points in the process as well as the parts of the process that she liked. This data helped us to later build a map of the user process flow from the very beginning (signing up for notifications) to the end (deciding whether or not to update).</p>

The team decided to instead focus on getting input on the content of these notifications using Desirability testing. We collectively chose 20 adjectives (10 positive and 10 negative) and had participants choose 3 adjectives to describe each design. We also collected their motivations for choosing these adjectives. Unfortunately, we were unable to get in contact with the users of 3PAR systems, so instead we looked to the Computer and Networking Information Technology major here at Purdue for participants who would be willing to give us input. While these participants were new to the 3PAR system, they possessed the necessary background knowledge to understand the notifications and the terminology used.</p>

This was done by using custom macros within Excel. Excel was able to give a weighted positivity score to each notification design. Looking at the highest and lowest scoring designs, we reflected on the qualitative data (the participants' comments) for each of these designs to determine the reasoning behind these scores. </p>

HPE was highly satisfied with our solution, and they appreciated the multi-channel approach we took towards delivering notifications to their users. They found that some solutions would be much easier to implement than others, and that we could expect to see our work reflected as early as the next few updates to 3PAR systems.</p>
